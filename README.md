Version 1.1
by Rumian

Currently only Chrome browser is supported.

To speed up things you can use keyboard.

	[f] key - get focus to search input, start typing MT function, class,
	method and see if built-in auto complete picks it up

	[t] key (or "Top 10" button) - view your top ten viewed pages and
	quickly jump to one of them using [0-9] keys; top 10 list is stored
	against your browser session and therefore unique to you

"Hello world!" and happy coding!
